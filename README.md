Project Preparation Activity 3




***IMPORTANT UPDATE: Due to git merge issues, we uploaded our files manually. When we tried to git pull and clone the project into a new file, we were getting errors. However, we noticed that the MakeFile was an older version and thus, missing the Food.o linker in line 3 of the MakeFile. On Monday Dec 4 at 2:40pm we added this to our MakeFile and manually re-uploaded it. We talked to Dr. Scott about this and he told us that NO MARKS WILL BE DEDUCTED for changing our MakeFile.
